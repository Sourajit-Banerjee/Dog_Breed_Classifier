# Dog_Breed_classifier_Pytorch 

Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) Project using Pytorch.This is my first project on Machine Learning(ML) and I used the Pytorch framaework for this project.



## Introduction

In this project I have  build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify an estimate of the dogâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will display an message "Hello Human" and  will identify the resembling dog breed.

### The  model distinguishes between the 133 breeds  of dogs with an accuracy of 85%  (test_accuracy over 836 test dog images).

## Datasets

The Datasets used for training,evaluating and testing are available at [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).

The dataset contains 8352 images in total, divided across 133 breeds and already split in training, validation, and test sets. On average, there are 50 training images per breed
