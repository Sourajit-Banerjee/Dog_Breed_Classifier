# Dog_Breed_classifier_Pytorch 

Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) Project using Pytorch.This is my first project on Machine Learning(ML) and I used the Pytorch framaework for this project.

In this project, one will learn how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, this algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. 
Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification and localization, you will make important design decisions about the user experience for your app. My goal is that by completing this lab, one can understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer. My imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!



## Introduction

In this project I have  build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify an estimate of the dog’s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will display an message "Hello Human" and  will identify the resembling dog breed.

### The  model distinguishes between the 133 breeds  of dogs with an accuracy of 85%  (test_accuracy over 836 test dog images).

## Datasets

The Datasets used for training,evaluating and testing are available at [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).

The dataset contains 8352 images in total, divided across 133 breeds and already split in training, validation, and test sets. On average, there are 50 training images per breed
